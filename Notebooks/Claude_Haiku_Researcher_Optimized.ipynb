        "## Introduction\n",
        "The Claude Haiku Researcher Optimized notebook is designed for developers and researchers who want to efficiently utilize Google and Anthropic APIs. It significantly reduces the cost of API usage, making it ideal for haiku research tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup Instructions\n",
        "To use this notebook effectively, ensure that your development environment is set up with the necessary Python libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## API Configuration\n",
        "Set up your environment variables or directly replace the placeholders in the code with your actual API keys. This configuration is essential for the proper functioning of the scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "!pip install google-api-python-client\n",
        "!pip install anthropic\n",

        "## History of Acoustic Guitars\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ancient Beginnings\n",
        "The origins of the acoustic guitar can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians and Greeks, who used similar stringed instruments like the lyre and the kithara. These early instruments were often made of wood and had a flat base, with strings of equal length.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Development of the Guitar\n",
        "The modern guitar evolved from the oud and the lute, which predate written history. The earliest known guitar-like instrument is a tanbur from Egypt, dating back to around 1500 BCE. Over the centuries, the design of the guitar continued to evolve, with various cultures and regions contributing to its development.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The 19th Century and the Spanish Guitar\n",
        "In the 19th century, Spanish musician Antonio de Torres Jurado created an instrument that was shaped similarly to today's acoustic guitars. He took the traditional guitar design and made improvements that enhanced the tone and volume of the instrument.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Age of Steel Strings\n",
        "In the late 1800s, silk strings with steel wrapping became available, leading to the development of the steel-string acoustic guitar. This new design allowed for a louder and more powerful sound, which was particularly useful for accompanying vocals and other instruments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Flat-Top Acoustic Guitar\n",
        "The flat-top acoustic guitar, with its distinctive soundhole and flat top, became the most popular form of acoustic guitar in the early 20th century. Luthiers like Christian Frederick Martin, a German-born American, played a significant role in the evolution of this design.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Innovations and Advancements\n",
        "Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, acoustic guitar design has continued to evolve, with various innovations and advancements. These include the development of the acoustic-electric guitar, the use of new materials and construction techniques, and the incorporation of advanced technologies like Yamaha's TransAcoustic technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recent Trends and Developments\n",
        "In recent years, the acoustic guitar market has seen several new trends and developments, including a focus on sustainability and eco-friendly designs, the rise of hybrid designs, the integration of smart technology, increased personalization and customization, and the growth of niche and specialty guitars.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of Acoustic Guitars\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dreadnought\n",
        "- The dreadnought is the most common and popular acoustic guitar body shape.\n",
        "- It is known for its large size, which produces a powerful, loud, and bass-heavy tone.\n",
        "- Dreadnoughts are often used for strumming and playing chords.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Orchestra Model (OM) / Auditorium\n",
        "- Also known as the \"000\" or auditorium shape, the OM is slightly smaller than a dreadnought.\n",
        "- It has a more balanced tone with good volume and dynamic range.\n",
        "- The OM is versatile and well-suited for fingerstyle playing as well as strumming.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Parlor\n",
        "- Parlor guitars are the smallest of the common acoustic guitar body shapes.\n",
        "- They have a more intimate, mellow, and focused tone.\n",
        "- Parlor guitars are often used for fingerstyle playing and are popular for their portability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Jumbo\n",
        "- Jumbo acoustic guitars are characterized by their large, wide body shape.\n",
        "- They are known for producing a powerful, booming sound with a strong low-end response.\n",
        "- Jumbo guitars are often used for playing chords and strumming in genres like folk, country, and rock.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Classical/Spanish\n",
        "- Classical or Spanish acoustic guitars have a distinctive nylon-string construction.\n",
        "- They are designed for fingerstyle playing and are commonly used in classical, flamenco, and Latin music styles.\n",
        "- Classical guitars typically have a smaller, more delicate body shape compared to steel-string acoustics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12-String\n",
        "- 12-string acoustic guitars have twice the number of strings as a standard 6-string guitar.\n",
        "- They produce a rich, full-bodied sound with a shimmering, chiming quality.\n",
        "- 12-string guitars are popular for their unique sonic character and are often used in folk, rock, and worship music.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Acoustic-Electric\n",
        "- Acoustic-electric guitars are equipped with built-in pickups and preamps, allowing them to be amplified and played through a PA system or amplifier.\n",
        "- They combine the natural, organic tone of an acoustic guitar with the versatility of electronic amplification.\n",
        "- Acoustic-electric guitars are widely used in live performances, recording studios, and amplified settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Construction and Materials of Acoustic Guitars\n",
        "\n",
        "### Materials Used in Acoustic Guitar Construction\n",
        "- **Tonewoods**: The most common tonewoods used for the back and sides of acoustic guitars include rosewood, mahogany, sapele, maple, koa, walnut, and sycamore.\n",
        "- **Tops/Soundboards**: The top or soundboard of an acoustic guitar is often made of cedar or spruce.\n",
        "- **Other Materials**: Bracing materials, fretboard and bridge materials, strings, and laminates/composites are also used in acoustic guitar construction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Acoustic Guitar Construction Techniques\n",
        "- Lamination: Laminating the guitar sides is a common practice to help prevent deformation over time.\n",
        "- Bracing: The bracing pattern and materials used for the guitar top and back play a crucial role in the instrument's tone and structural integrity.\n",
        "- Neck Joint: The design and construction of the neck joint, where the neck meets the body, is an important consideration for guitar builders.\n",
        "- Jigs and Fixtures: The use of specialized jigs and fixtures is common in acoustic guitar construction, as they help achieve precision and consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Factors Affecting Acoustic Guitar Sound\n",
        "- Wood Composition: The choice of tonewoods for the top, back, and sides, as well as the bracing materials, can significantly impact the guitar's tone, volume, and overall sound character.\n",
        "- String Materials: The composition of the guitar strings, including the core and winding materials, can affect the tonal qualities, such as brightness, warmth, and sustain.\n",
        "- Environmental Factors: The climate and environmental conditions can impact the stability and performance of an acoustic guitar, particularly with regards to the wood materials.\n",
