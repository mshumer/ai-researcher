        "## Introduction\n",
        "This Python script generates comprehensive research reports on a given topic by leveraging the power of Anthropic's AI models and Google's Custom Search API. It automates the process of researching subtopics, generating detailed reports, and combining them into a final comprehensive report.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- Utilizes Anthropic's AI models for generating search queries, analyzing search results, and creating detailed reports\n",
        "- Integrates with Google's Custom Search API to perform web searches and gather relevant information\n",
        "- Generates a checklist of subtopics to research based on the main topic\n",
        "- Produces detailed reports for each subtopic, including additional searches to fill in gaps and provide more information\n",
        "- Combines subtopic reports into a comprehensive report, ensuring all information is included and well-structured\n",
        "- Saves the final comprehensive report as a Markdown file in the \"reports\" directory\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "1. Set up your environment variables:\n",
        "   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key\n",
        "   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Search API key\n",
        "   - `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`: Your Custom Search Engine ID\n",
        "2. Install the required dependencies:\n",
        "   - `googleapiclient`\n",
        "   - `anthropic`\n",
        "   - `requests`\n",
        "3. Run the script and enter the research topic when prompted\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "1. Run the script using `python script_name.py`\n",
        "2. Enter the research topic when prompted\n",
        "3. The script will generate a checklist of subtopics to research\n",
        "4. For each subtopic, the script will:\n",
        "   - Generate initial search queries\n",
        "   - Perform web searches using the Google Custom Search API\n",
        "   - Generate an initial report based on the search results\n",
        "   - Analyze the report and generate additional search queries to fill in gaps\n",
        "   - Update the report with the new information\n",
        "5. The script will combine the subtopic reports into a comprehensive report\n",
        "6. The comprehensive report will be saved as a Markdown file in the \"reports\" directory\n",
        "\n",
        "## File Structure\n",
        "- `script_name.py`: The main Python script\n",
        "- `reports/`: Directory to store the generated comprehensive reports\n",
        "\n",
        "## Customization\n",
        "- Adjust the `RESEARCH_MODEL` and `REPORT_MODEL` variables to select different Anthropic AI models for research and report generation tasks\n",
        "- Modify the prompts and instructions provided to the AI models to customize the generated reports\n",
        "- Adjust the `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters in the `generate_text` function to control the length and creativity of the generated content\n",
        "\n",
        "## Troubleshooting\n",
        "- If the script encounters unsupported characters when saving the report, try modifying the generated report to remove any unsupported characters or use a different research topic\n",
        "- If the script fails to generate search queries or reports, check the format of the AI model's response and ensure it matches the expected format\n",
        "- If the script encounters errors related to API keys or authentication, double-check your environment variables and ensure they are set correctly\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "This comprehensive research report generator streamlines the process of researching and creating detailed reports on a given topic. By leveraging AI models and web search capabilities, it automates the tedious tasks of information gathering and report writing, allowing users to focus on analyzing and utilizing the generated insights."

        "\n",
        "### Coordinate System and Shapes\n",
        "\n",
        "P5.js uses a Cartesian coordinate system, with the origin (0, 0) at the top-left corner of the canvas. You can draw a variety of shapes, including points, lines, rectangles, ellipses, and polygons, using the corresponding functions provided by the library. The coordinate system can be modified using functions like `translate()` and `scale()` to change the origin and flip the y-axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Color and Drawing\n",
        "\n",
        "P5.js offers a range of functions for working with color, including setting the fill and stroke colors, using RGB or HSB color modes, and creating gradients. You can also use the `background()` function to set the background color of the canvas. It's important to note that color variables need to be defined in the appropriate scope (e.g., `setup()` or `draw()`) to be accessible throughout your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interactivity\n",
        "\n",
        "P5.js makes it easy to create interactive sketches by providing access to various user input events, such as mouse clicks, key presses, and touch events. You can use these events to trigger animations, change the appearance of objects, or control the behavior of your application. The library also includes functions for accessing mouse and keyboard data, which can be used to create more complex interactive experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Program Flow and Control\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the `setup()` and `draw()` functions, P5.js provides a variety of control structures, such as `if-else` statements, `for` and `while` loops, and custom functions, to help you organize and control the flow of your program. These control structures allow you to make decisions, iterate over data, and break out of loops, enabling you to create more complex and dynamic sketches.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Drawing Functions in P5.js\n",
        "\n",
        "### The `draw()` Function\n",
        "\n",
        "The `draw()` function is a core component of the P5.js library, as it is responsible for continuously executing the code inside its block until the program is stopped or `noLoop()` is called. The `draw()` function is called after the `setup()` function, and it runs in a loop, executing the code from top to bottom repeatedly. It can be used to draw shapes, lines, images, and text on the canvas, as well as create animations and interactive experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Coordinate System and Shapes\n",
        "\n",
        "The P5.js canvas uses a Cartesian coordinate system, where the origin (0, 0) is located at the top-left corner of the canvas. The `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()` functions can be used to modify the coordinate system, allowing you to draw shapes and objects in different positions and orientations. The `beginShape()` and `endShape()` functions can be used to create custom shapes by drawing a series of vertices. Other basic shape drawing functions include `rect()`, `ellipse()`, `triangle()`, and `quad()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Transformations\n",
        "\n",
        "P5.js provides several functions for transforming the coordinate system, including `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()`. These functions can be used to position, rotate, and scale objects on the canvas. The `push()` and `pop()` functions are also important for managing transformations. The `push()` function saves the current drawing style settings and transformations, while `pop()` restores these settings. This allows you to apply transformations to specific elements without affecting the entire canvas.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Blending and Image Manipulation\n",
        "\n",
        "P5.js provides functions for blending and manipulating images on the canvas. The `blendMode()` function sets the mode for blending pixels, with options like `BLEND`, `DARKEST`, `LIGHTEST`, `DIFFERENCE`, and more. The `blend()` function can be used to blend two images together using a specified blending mode. The `tint()` function can be used to apply a color filter to an image, while the `filter()` function applies various image processing filters, such as `GRAY`, `THRESHOLD`, `INVERT`, and `BLUR`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Text Rendering Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "P5.js also provides functions for rendering text on the canvas. The main function for this is `text()`, which takes a string and the x and y coordinates where the text should be drawn. Other text-related functions include `textSize()`, `textAlign()`, `textFont()`, and `textStyle()`. These functions can be used to add textual elements to the canvas, such as labels, captions, or interactive UI components.\n",
        "\n",
